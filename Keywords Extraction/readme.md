# KeyWords Extraction
* It is task of Natural Language Processing.
* Automatically identifies a **set of terms** to describe the subject of text.
* It plays a major role in information retrieval(IR) systems: keywords simplify and speed up research.
* It can also be used to reduce text dimensionality for text analysis(subject modeling text classification).
* It can be used in:
  * automatically indexing data
  * summarizing text
  * generating tag clouds with most representative keywords.

Techniques used for this problem in this notebook:
* TF-IDF implementation from scratch
* Using TF-IDF transformer from sklearn
* Using Gensim model

Please look at the flow-chart provided below to get the idea of implementation.
