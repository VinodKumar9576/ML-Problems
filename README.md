# ML-Problems

In this repository you can find various ML categories of ML problems that are useful for brushing up different modelling techniques and feature engineering. All the work is done in Google colaboratory which is very useful jupyter notebook environment linked with Google drive storage. Also all of my work is pushed to Github from colab directly.<br>
So after all you need "Colab + Drive + Github".

Hope you'll enjoy this!!
